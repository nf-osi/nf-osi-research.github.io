The survey aimed evaluate pain points or barriers in these three key areas to understand where the most impactful improvements could be made.\nResults and Analysis\nRespondent profiles\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Demographic representation of survey respondents\n\n\n\nThough the number of respondents (n=13) is a modest sample size, respondents do nevertheless represent different types of users.\nFigure 1 summarizes the relative abundance of six demographic types.\nBecause respondents could indicate more than one demographic type, a statistic of 54% here should be interpreted to mean that 54% of the responses represented the “Principal Investigator” profile.\nThat the survey has such large representation of Principal Investigator (PIs), more than for any other type of user, is encouraging.\nThese are community constituents who have significant say in how research should be done, e.g. how to both obtain and share data for a study.\nOn the other hand, there are several caveats in the respondent profile that should be noted.\nFirst is the relatively low percentage of bioinformaticians/computational biologists, which would be the demographic expected to be doing the practical, hands-on reuse of data.\nThis proportion for bioinformaticians/computational biologists is also about the same as a previous RFC survey.\nA data portal should arguably see over-representation of bioinformaticians in its userbase, suggesting that the Portal either needs to have more bioinformatician users or increase survey engagement for this group.\n\nThe second issue is that the survey question did not adequately admit additional demographics.\nOne other type of user that should perhaps have been captured is the “rare disease patient or patient advocate”.\nIn further research and follow-up, we did see that a small minority of respondents fit into this demographic, though this is not apparent in the official responses because of the way the question was structured.\n\n\n\nData findability\nData discovery is an important antecedent to data reuse.\nThe first survey component asked about issues community users might encounter when trying to find data through the NF Data Portal.\nOf several issues that might hamper findability, Figure 2 indicates that a confusing user interface had the most severe effect, though poor search functionality was also detrimental.\nHalf or nearly half of users found it “hard” or “impossible” to find data because of these two issues.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Caption\n\n\n\nData reuse\nThe second part of the survey asked community users to reveal what might have negatively impacted their ability to reuse data.\nWithin this area, there were two quite different potential issues: the technical issue of transfer capacity versus the more business-operational issue of dealing with an embargo period.\nThe first has evidence of being the more problematic one, as shown in Figure 3, though it seems both affected a minority of users.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Caption\n\n\n\nData sharing\nData sharing through the NF platform includes not only uploading data but also providing metadata (annotations) for the data, thus this survey section asked about the experience of uploading and using our annotation tools.\nFigure 4 shows that the issue which made upload “hard” or “impossible” for the largest share of users was “confusing or insufficient instructions”.\nEven though other issues affected a smaller share of users, they still represent major blockers for those users who said these made upload “impossible”.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Caption\n\n\n\nAs with data upload, the majority and largest proportion of users thought “confusing or insufficient instructions” was a real issue (Figure 5).\nOverall, data annotation also had somewhat more users with negative experiences than data upload.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Caption\n\n\n\nOverall comparison\nAll issues except for metadata completeness had users who thought it made it “impossible” to achieve data discovery, sharing, or reuse.\nThat means that there are some users being left behind in all of these areas.\nUsers were also asked to provide a rating to summarize their overall experience in each area.\nWhen comparing the response distribution for these different areas all together, we see somewhat interestingly that the responses tend to be bi-modal (Figure ??).\nUsers who respond appear to be really pretty dissatisfied or pretty satisfied.\nWhile there is no area that is truly terrible, data sharing does have the lowest overall rating, with metadata sharing through the Data Curator App does having the lowest experience rating of 3 (Table ??).\nTo improve the data sharing experience, the analysis has already suggested having clearer instructions and making sure they are seen by users.\nHowever, user comments also provide the insight that instructions become an issue because the current order/decoupling of events for data sharing is unintuitive – data annotation should be done with data upload, not after.\nThus it may not be really that more instructions are needed but that the process could be simpler and more intuitive.\nThis would require both a technological and operational improvement to better combine data upload and annotation.\nGiven that data sharing should be prioritized first, the next prioritization chooses between data findability versus data reuse.\nThe survey results suggests that data findability affected more users.\nBoth search functionality and the user interface are issues to target for data findability.\n\n\n\n\n\narea\n      mean\n    How would you generally rate your experience of trying to annotate NF data through the Data Curator App (https://sagebio.shinyapps.io/NF_data_curator/)?\n3.00How would you generally rate your experience of trying to download NF data?\n3.46How would you generally rate your experience of trying to find NF data through the NF Data Portal (https://nf.synapse.org/)?\n3.38How would you generally rate your experience of trying to upload NF data?\n3.46\n\nOther discussion\nOutside of the main survey, users left comments and suggestions regarding data sharing and the portal.\nOne theme hinted at by these qualitative results that were not covered in the above analysis is improving data accessibility to patients.\nContinuing research\nThese preliminary results helped to establish a baseline for our community’s experience and to recommend the right allocation of resources for improvement.\nNevertheless, the modest sample sizes could have possibly skewed responses for certain areas and types of users.\nThe portal survey remains open to collect more data.\nTo make it more inclusive we will likely revise the respondent profiling question to include other demographics options.\nAside from getting more trustworthy sample sizes and findings, the continuation of the survey will allow trend analysis to see how experiences change over time.\nThe results will be integrated into plans for continuous improvement in data discovery, sharing, and reuse as the NF data platform (hopefully) continues to expand and receive investment.\nThe survey is also somewhat restricted in the insights that could be obtained because of greater focus on quantitative data and specific issues.\nMore open-ended and qualitative research could extend the research to uncovered issues as well as explore ideas on how to build a better portal.\nA number of respondents indicated that they were willing to participate in interviews as part of this more qualitative exploration, which might be done through partnership with the Sage design team.\n\n\n\n",

statistics\nRespondent profiles\nSurvey quantified responses\n\n\nAbstract\nThe NF Data Portal community is dedicated towards bringing the latest data and research from the NF research community to the world.\nIn doing so the Portal maintains and implements FAIR standards to make various types of research data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.\nRecently the Portal community reached out to the research community asking feedback regarding sharing logistics of various data types and their file formats.\nThis document describes data types and formats that should be shared by the Neurofibromatosis (NF) research community for the NF Data Portal.\nIntroduction\nThe NF Data Portal is a collaborative data-sharing platform for Neurofibromatosis, a rare genetic disease (Allaway et al. 2019).\nIt has been jointly supported by multiple funding organizations – the Gilbert Family Foundation (GFF), Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP), NCI Developmental and Hyperactive Ras Tumor SPORE (DHART SPORE), CDMRP Neurofibromatosis Research Program (CDMRP NFRP), and Neurofibromatosis Research Initiative (NFRI) – and therefore represents substantial NF research activity.\nAs the NF Data Portal community continues to expand to add newly affiliated as well as independent researchers, and therefore new data, having these standards will help maintain the quality and quantity of our valuable resources.\nBut also important is that this document should actually benefit our data contributors.\n\nOne advantage is allowing our contributors to prioritize submissions accordingly.\nAs well, our contributors have a clear reference for the data formats that are preferred for sharing.\nThese specifications should lead to higher-impact data through encouraging interoperable formats that make data more likely to be reused (and cited).\nFinally, this open document lets our community be informed of the current state of art, including specifications currently not included, so that they can provide input towards specific/new data formats.\nThe data-sharing specifications highlighted in this document have been informed by members in the research community, using their opinions solicited through an open Request for Comments (RFC).\nThe feedback received from the community was especially influential for data types outside of what is required by default, i.e. more “optional” data types.\nThese specifications also follow requirements already established by the NF-OSI funding organizations, which apply to data types with clear “reusability” value and for which there are well-defined strategies for sharing (e.g. sequencing data).\nJournal requirements and other repositories were considered to a much lesser extent.\nData types and formats summary\nAs a representation of the most recent funder requirements and RFC results, table 1 summarizes specifications for common data types that are of interest for the NF community.\nThese standards should apply for most general cases.\nHowever, we do note that for some data types, the community provided additional considerations that serve to qualify or supplement what is in this table (see Additional considerations).\nThis qualitative feedback point to certain data domains that may need deeper evaluation.\nAlongside the qualitative results, quantitative breakdowns for components of the RFC are available (see RFC statistics).\n\n\nTable 1: Specifications for relevant common data types.\n  \n      Requirement\n      Levelsa\n      Format\n

\n\nAdditional considerations\n\nThe current specifications should guide contributions in the “spirit of effective data sharing” and are most applicable when they lead to intended results, e.g. higher-impact shared data and reasonable balance of contributor/administrative effort given the expected value of the data shared.\n\nBut there can be debatable cases where a “required” specification is less applicable.\nThe community has anticipated issues like these and provided recommendations for some of them.\nHowever, difficult and unclear cases remain or may yet emerge, which will need more community consensus still.\n\nImaging data\nComments from the community noted two possible issues for imaging data.\nA first question is whether imaging data should be shared when there are at most only a few images, which is of limited utility for re-analysis (e.g. with machine learning) usually requiring a large set of images.\nThat is, imaging data may require a “critical mass”.\nWhen only a few images are contributed, these are likely only representative images that might also appear in a publication.\nIn this case, it may not be really “required” that these images have to be shared.\nA second case is for a study that may generate many images but can only process and fully annotate a subset.\nFor example, there can be a large number of pathology images without any annotations of disease features by a pathologist, as these kinds of annotations are manually intensive.\nIf all data are expected to be annotated – and annotations are especially important for the usefulness of the images – the question arises whether images outside the fully annotated subset should be shared.\nA clear suggestion seems to be that sharing images without annotations is better than not sharing images – for some images, it is possible for someone else to go back and add annotations.\nNote that basic, automatic annotations are still expected; using the example above, the images should still have an associated sample ID and tissue source.\nClinical data\nClinical data can be extremely diverse and unstructured.\nWhile we have incorporated comments for structured clinical data, we have not received comments for unstructured clinical data such as patient histories that are often captured in text reports.\nClinical data still remains very open to comment from those in the community.\nAlternative assay/platform data\nThe specifications table includes the most common assay data types instead of enumerating all variants or alternatives.\nAn insightful community observation suggested there can be less common but better alternatives for some assays.\nThe example given was using a WES capillary protein analysis system in lieu of traditional western blot for easier analysis as well as raw data sharing.\nThis is actually asking a different design question – not necessarily “What level and format of data should be used for better sharing?” but “What assays/platform should be used for better sharing?”\nIt is certainly not within our purview to specify what should be used, and experiments will have to be planned around what assays the researchers are familiar with and what equipment is available.\nWe are also aware that researchers are not likely to think about data sharing specifications until results have been generated, while this kind of consideration would take place before experiments even start.\nNevertheless, if the investigator is at the juncture of a design decision, awareness of alternatives and their relative merit in terms of data sharing could be helpful.\n\nUnfortunately, this aspect is not captured well in our current specifications.\nWe welcome the community providing more suggestions in this regard.\n\nRFC statistics\nRespondent profiles\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Demographic representation of RFC community respondents\n\n\n\nFigure 1 summarizes the representation of different demographic types as self-reported through the question “What ‘type’ of NF research community member are you?”\nBecause respondents could indicate more than one demographic type, a statistic of 43% here should be interpreted to mean that 43% of the responses represented the clinician perspective.\nOverall, the RFC garnered highest representation from bench scientists and clinicians, which was expected.\nThat clinicians had nearly as much representation as bench scientists likely reflects the highly translational focus of the NF Data Portal community relative to more general data repositories.\nIn the RFC, we did not distinguish whether respondents considered themselves more a “data contributor”, a “data re-user” or possibly “equally both”.\nIn the future, this additional facet may provide additional insight in case there are conflicts in perspectives between these profiles.\n\n\n\nSurvey quantified responses\n\n\n\nFigure 2 summarizes responses to the question “Should it be required to deposit raw data?” for the different assay or different type categories.\nThere were four categories that reached majority consensus for sharing: in vivo growth tumor data, Sanger sequencing, structured clinical data, and western blot.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Survey responses for whether depositing raw data should be required for different assays\n\n\n\nFigure 3 summarizes responses to the question “Have you ever re-analyzed this type of data, or wanted to, if the right dataset existed?” for the different assay or different type categories.\nThe highest interest was for structured clinical data, which also garnered the strongest consensus that it should be shared (Fig 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Survey responses for previous experience or interest in re-analyzing data for different assays\n\n\n\nFigure 4 summarizes responses to the question “Have you previously been required to share a complete raw dataset by a funder or journal?”\nThe responses suggest that funder or journal sharing requirements for these assays or data types are not common, except for perhaps structured clinical data and western blots.\nCompared to ratings in Fig 2, the results here also suggest that the community is willing to go beyond the “baseline” requirements of funders or journals.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Survey responses for previous requirements to share raw data by a funder or journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllaway, Robert J.,
