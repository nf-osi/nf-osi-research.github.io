So there may be a sex related effect on the analysis that we dont have a good way to mitigate.\nThe number of MPNST samples are extremely limited (n=4), so these results should be evaluated with more samples when possible\nThe plot below shows genes that are significantly overexpressed in MPNST compared to PNF (logFC > 4) in red. The dots in blue refer to genes that are significantly underexpressed in MPNST compared to PNF (logFC < -4). The thresholds of fold change have been arbitrarily chosen for ease of visualization in the volcano plot shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Differential expression of genes in MPNST and pNF tumor types. Above shows a volcano plot highlighting significantly upregulated genes in red and downregulated genes in blue\n\n\n\nPredicting drug candidates based on significant DEGs using DRUID:\nWe then took the subset of genes that were significantly differentially expressed between MPNST and pNF tumor types and used DRUID to enrich candidate drugs to revert the MPNST phenotype to pNF phenotype. We did this using the following steps:\n\n\n# Select the significantly differentially expressed genes from DEG analysis\ndruid_dge <- MPNSTvsPNF %>% \n  dplyr::select(c(\"logFC\",\"adj.P.Val\")) %>% \n  dplyr::filter(MPNSTvsPNF$adj.P.Val < 0.05)\n  \n# Make query matrix for DRUID\nquery_matrix <- as.matrix(druid_dge)\n\n# Convert the gene names to entrez ids\ngeneSymbols <- AnnotationDbi::mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, \n                                     keys=rownames(query_matrix), \n                                     column=c(\"ENTREZID\"), \n                                     keytype=\"SYMBOL\", \n                                     multiVals = \"first\") %>% as.data.frame()\n#head(geneSymbols)\nentrez_ids <- geneSymbols$.\n\n# # Run Druid with only significant genes (adj_p_val < 0.05) and save output\n# sig_genes_druid <- concoct(dge_matrix = query_matrix, \n#                            num_random = 10000, \n#                            druid_direction = \"neg\", \n#                            fold_thr = 0.5, \n#                            pvalue_thr = 0.05, \n#                            entrez = entrez_ids)\n# sig_genes_druid_ordered <- sig_genes_druid[order(sig_genes_druid$druid_score, decreasing = TRUE),]\n# #head(sig_genes_druid_ordered)\n# \n# save(sig_genes_druid_ordered, file = \"./sig_genes_druid_mpnst_pnf.RData\")\n\nload(\"./sig_genes_druid_mpnst_pnf.RData\")\n\n\nsig_genes_druid_ordered %>% \n  dplyr::filter(., druid_score > 5) %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x = drug_name, y = cosine_similarity, color = cell_line), alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_grid(. ~ cell_line, scales = \"free\") + \n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: DRUID predictions for significant DEGs\n\n\n\nThe table below lists all the drugs that were recommended as promising candidates using the DRUID analysis. A higher DRUID score (scale from 0-6) would mean a higher recommendation for the drug compound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\nLearn more about using Distill for R Markdown at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",

statistics\nRespondent profiles\nSurvey quantified responses\n\n\nAbstract\nThe NF Data Portal community is dedicated towards bringing the latest data and research from the NF research community to the world.\nIn doing so the Portal maintains and implements FAIR standards to make various types of research data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.\nRecently the Portal community reached out to the research community asking feedback regarding sharing logistics of various data types and their file formats.\nThis document describes data types and formats that should be shared by the Neurofibromatosis (NF) research community for the NF Data Portal.\nIntroduction\nThe NF Data Portal is a collaborative data-sharing platform for Neurofibromatosis, a rare genetic disease (Allaway et al. 2019).\nIt has been jointly supported by multiple funding organizations – the Gilbert Family Foundation (GFF), Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP), NCI Developmental and Hyperactive Ras Tumor SPORE (DHART SPORE), CDMRP Neurofibromatosis Research Program (CDMRP NFRP), and Neurofibromatosis Research Initiative (NFRI) – and therefore represents substantial NF research activity.\nAs the NF Data Portal community continues to expand to add newly affiliated as well as independent researchers, and therefore new data, having these standards will help maintain the quality and quantity of our valuable resources.\nBut also important is that this document should actually benefit our data contributors.\n\nOne advantage is allowing our contributors to prioritize submissions accordingly.\nAs well, our contributors have a clear reference for the data formats that are preferred for sharing.\nThese specifications should lead to higher-impact data through encouraging interoperable formats that make data more likely to be reused (and cited).\nFinally, this open document lets our community be informed of the current state of art, including specifications currently not included, so that they can provide input towards specific/new data formats.\nThe data-sharing specifications highlighted in this document have been informed by members in the research community, using their opinions solicited through an open Request for Comments (RFC).\nThe feedback received from the community was especially influential for data types outside of what is required by default, i.e. more “optional” data types.\nThese specifications also follow requirements already established by the NF-OSI funding organizations, which apply to data types with clear “reusability” value and for which there are well-defined strategies for sharing (e.g. sequencing data).\nJournal requirements and other repositories were considered to a much lesser extent.\nData types and formats summary\nAs a representation of the most recent funder requirements and RFC results, table 1 summarizes specifications for common data types that are of interest for the NF community.\nThese standards should apply for most general cases.\nHowever, we do note that for some data types, the community provided additional considerations that serve to qualify or supplement what is in this table (see Additional considerations).\nThis qualitative feedback point to certain data domains that may need deeper evaluation.\nAlongside the qualitative results, quantitative breakdowns for components of the RFC are available (see RFC statistics).\n\n\nTable 1: Specifications for relevant common data types.\n  \n      Requirement\n      Levelsa\n      Format\n

\n\nAdditional considerations\n\nThe current specifications should guide contributions in the “spirit of effective data sharing” and are most applicable when they lead to intended results, e.g. higher-impact shared data and reasonable balance of contributor/administrative effort given the expected value of the data shared.\n\nBut there can be debatable cases where a “required” specification is less applicable.\nThe community has anticipated issues like these and provided recommendations for some of them.\nHowever, difficult and unclear cases remain or may yet emerge, which will need more community consensus still.\n\nImaging data\nComments from the community noted two possible issues for imaging data.\nA first question is whether imaging data should be shared when there are at most only a few images, which is of limited utility for re-analysis (e.g. with machine learning) usually requiring a large set of images.\nThat is, imaging data may require a “critical mass”.\nWhen only a few images are contributed, these are likely only representative images that might also appear in a publication.\nIn this case, it may not be really “required” that these images have to be shared.\nA second case is for a study that may generate many images but can only process and fully annotate a subset.\nFor example, there can be a large number of pathology images without any annotations of disease features by a pathologist, as these kinds of annotations are manually intensive.\nIf all data are expected to be annotated – and annotations are especially important for the usefulness of the images – the question arises whether images outside the fully annotated subset should be shared.\nA clear suggestion seems to be that sharing images without annotations is better than not sharing images – for some images, it is possible for someone else to go back and add annotations.\nNote that basic, automatic annotations are still expected; using the example above, the images should still have an associated sample ID and tissue source.\nClinical data\nClinical data can be extremely diverse and unstructured.\nWhile we have incorporated comments for structured clinical data, we have not received comments for unstructured clinical data such as patient histories that are often captured in text reports.\nClinical data still remains very open to comment from those in the community.\nAlternative assay/platform data\nThe specifications table includes the most common assay data types instead of enumerating all variants or alternatives.\nAn insightful community observation suggested there can be less common but better alternatives for some assays.\nThe example given was using a WES capillary protein analysis system in lieu of traditional western blot for easier analysis as well as raw data sharing.\nThis is actually asking a different design question – not necessarily “What level and format of data should be used for better sharing?” but “What assays/platform should be used for better sharing?”\nIt is certainly not within our purview to specify what should be used, and experiments will have to be planned around what assays the researchers are familiar with and what equipment is available.\nWe are also aware that researchers are not likely to think about data sharing specifications until results have been generated, while this kind of consideration would take place before experiments even start.\nNevertheless, if the investigator is at the juncture of a design decision, awareness of alternatives and their relative merit in terms of data sharing could be helpful.\n\nUnfortunately, this aspect is not captured well in our current specifications.\nWe welcome the community providing more suggestions in this regard.\n\nRFC statistics\nRespondent profiles\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Demographic representation of RFC community respondents\n\n\n\nFigure 1 summarizes the representation of different demographic types as self-reported through the question “What ‘type’ of NF research community member are you?”\nBecause respondents could indicate more than one demographic type, a statistic of 43% here should be interpreted to mean that 43% of the responses represented the clinician perspective.\nOverall, the RFC garnered highest representation from bench scientists and clinicians, which was expected.\nThat clinicians had nearly as much representation as bench scientists likely reflects the highly translational focus of the NF Data Portal community relative to more general data repositories.\nIn the RFC, we did not distinguish whether respondents considered themselves more a “data contributor”, a “data re-user” or possibly “equally both”.\nIn the future, this additional facet may provide additional insight in case there are conflicts in perspectives between these profiles.\n\n\n\nSurvey quantified responses\n\n\n\nFigure 2 summarizes responses to the question “Should it be required to deposit raw data?” for the different assay or different type categories.\nThere were four categories that reached majority consensus for sharing: in vivo growth tumor data, Sanger sequencing, structured clinical data, and western blot.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Survey responses for whether depositing raw data should be required for different assays\n\n\n\nFigure 3 summarizes responses to the question “Have you ever re-analyzed this type of data, or wanted to, if the right dataset existed?” for the different assay or different type categories.\nThe highest interest was for structured clinical data, which also garnered the strongest consensus that it should be shared (Fig 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Survey responses for previous experience or interest in re-analyzing data for different assays\n\n\n\nFigure 4 summarizes responses to the question “Have you previously been required to share a complete raw dataset by a funder or journal?”\nThe responses suggest that funder or journal sharing requirements for these assays or data types are not common, except for perhaps structured clinical data and western blots.\nCompared to ratings in Fig 2, the results here also suggest that the community is willing to go beyond the “baseline” requirements of funders or journals.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Survey responses for previous requirements to share raw data by a funder or journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllaway, Robert J.,
